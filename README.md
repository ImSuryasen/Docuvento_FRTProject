## Azure Services
I used two Azure services for this project:
  1. Azure Static Web Apps
  2. Azure Health Bot

## Azure Static Web Apps
I uploaded all the code files in the github and connected that with the Microsoft Azure Static Web App to deploy my website through the Azure Services and hence recieved a globally visible link for the website.
